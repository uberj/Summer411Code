TESTS
=====
*Test's for big number operations*

Structure
---------
All tests will be run in the Testing/ sub directory. Numbers being used in the
test's will be stored in Testing/numbers. Numbers will be stored in triplets.
The two numbers being operated on (or one number) will be stored in files with
the format:
    ascii_big_num[1-90-9][a-z][AMSEDIDT][1-90-9].txt

The first letter number represents what test number the file belongs to. The
letter after that is a unique id within that test. 'AMSEDIPT' represents the
following operations

    A - Addition
    M - Multiplication
    S - Expenentiation
    D - Division
    I - Incriment
    P - Decrement
    T - Two's Compliment

Test Structure
--------------
A test will run with three parameters made up of at most four files. Two files will be the big numbers themselves. The third file will be the expected output
and the fourth file will be the actual output. After the program executes and
output is saved to the output file, the bash script should 'diff' the expected
and actual results and fail the test if need be.

    ./run_test -[AMSEDIPT] <big num1> <big num2> <expected> <actual>

AUTOMATION
==========
Use the...
    ./make_test.sh
script to write a test.
Run...
    ./runtest.sh
...to run the test suit.
